## Development Status

Loto is currently in active development. Implemented features:

✅ **Core Language**
- Function definitions with optional typing
- Classes with constructors and methods
- String interpolation
- Basic control flow

✅ **Frontend Components** 
- Component syntax with props/state/render/style blocks
- Event binding and template interpolation
- Scoped styling with camelCase properties

✅ **Tooling**
- CLI with `run` (interpreted) and `build` (compiled) modes
- Comprehensive test suite
- JavaScript code generation

🚧 **Planned Features**
- Control flow (if/else, loops, pattern matching)
- Module system and imports
- Asynchronous programming with fibers
- Self-hosting compiler
- Native compilation targets
